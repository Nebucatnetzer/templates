* Project Templates

A repository containing various templates to start a new project.

** Python
*** CLI

This is a template to create a simple command line programme. It uses
the very useful [[http://docopt.org/][docopt]] library. I got initially inspired to create
this template by this [[https://stormpath.com/blog/building-simple-cli-interfaces-in-python][article]].
